In-game observations:
- medpod should reserve stock for operation at the beginning
- medpod should have its progress bar rotated after orientation

- [to test]medpod should be a valid and preffered location for crawling pawns: [experiment] in progress, changed to bed for now



[to test] !!! bad back was not fixed !!! -> if pawn has hediff maybe operation does not apply?

[to test]!!! critical panic replacing important part like neck and or heart etc will kill the pawn

extra:
- operations should apply a healing debuff to the operated part; brain-machine interfacing for artificial parts + wound, wound for natural, etc

[done]add a fuel filter: ~a tab was added, shows all items in game~
[done]add a fuel gizmo: ~gizmo added, does not control max buffer size~

[done/rejected/refactored] ! select pawn gizmo 
[done] !! must have in-game mod menu to select log level
[rejected/refactored]!! selecting pod billtab keeps re-selecting the pod in an annoying cycle
